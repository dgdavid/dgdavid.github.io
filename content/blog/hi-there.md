Jesús **David Díaz** González here, a software developer from [La
Aldea de San
Nicolás](https://www.google.es/maps/place/La+Aldea+de+San+Nicol%C3%A1s,+Las+Palmas/@27.945466,-15.8544958,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xc4062a9c0e6e8f9:0x40340f3be4d1420!8m2!3d27.9822218!4d-15.7793741)<sup>[1][2]</sup>.

After working for the Web platform during 10 years, recently I became a [YaST
Team Member (YTM)](https://github.com/orgs/yast/people) :clap::clap::clap: at
[SUSE](https://www.suse.com), a great and exciting challenge which allows me to
leave the comfort zone and dedicate my work-time to an open source project.

I have always wanted to have a blog to tell something, but until now...
nevermind. I will try to do it from now on, although I am not quite sure if I
will have enough discipline :sweat_smile:, motivation  :muscle: and, above
all, (interesting) things to write :sunglasses:

This first entry can be considered as a mix between the classic `Hello World!`
and a partial `About me` section.

Let's go.
