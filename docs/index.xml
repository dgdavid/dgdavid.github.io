      <description>At the beginning of July, I started to work at SUSE as a member of the YaST team. A wanted, great, and stimulating step in my professional career 😊. Just one week after, I could enjoy the Hack Week 17 which is
 the time SUSE engineers experiment, innovate &amp;amp; learn interruption-free for a whole week &amp;ndash; [SUSE Hack Week homepage]
 My first Hack Week! So exciting! 🎉🎉🎉
I was tempted to start learning a new language or framework, but instead I decided to do something related to YaST in order to get more familiar with it and its ecosystem.</description>

      <description>Jesús David Díaz González here, a software developer from La Aldea de San Nicolás[1][2].
After working for the Web platform during 10 years, recently I became a YaST Team Member (YTM) 👏👏👏 at SUSE, a great and exciting challenge which allows me to leave the comfort zone and dedicate my work-time to an open source project.
I have always wanted to have a blog to tell something, but until now&amp;hellip; nevermind.</description>
