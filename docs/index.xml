      <description>Jesús David Díaz González here, a software developer from La Aldea de San Nicolás[1][2]
After working for the Web platform during 10 years, recently I became a YaST Member Team (YTM) 👏👏👏 at SUSE, a great and exciting challenge which allows me leave the comfort zone and dedicate my work-time to an open source project.
I have always wanted to have a blog to tell something, but until now&amp;hellip; nevermind. I will try to do it from now on, although I am not quite sure if I will have enough discipline 😅😅, motivation and, above all, (interesting) things to write.</description>
