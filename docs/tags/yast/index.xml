      <description>At the beginning of July, I started to work at SUSE as a member of the YaST team. A wanted, great, and stimulating step in my professional career ðŸ˜Š. Just one week after, I could enjoy the Hack Week 17 which is
 the time SUSE engineers experiment, innovate &amp;amp; learn interruption-free for a whole week &amp;ndash; [SUSE Hack Week homepage]
 My first Hack Week! So exciting! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
I was tempted to start learning a new language or framework, but instead I decided to do something related to YaST in order to get more familiar with it and its ecosystem.</description>
